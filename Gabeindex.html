    <p>Smallmouth fishing is one of my favorite past times. Every year my friends and I take a trip to Lake Saint Clair to fish specifically for smallmouth bass. This past year was our best year yet, catching over two dozen smallmouth that weighed over four pounds, and one that toped five and a half pounds. </p>

    <p>One of the best parts of the trips that we take is the last two years I have taken my gopro with me. Last year I made a two part video of our trip which I love to go back and watch. This year I am planning on making a three part video searies, each with a different story. This time the videos will be shorter though, because I think the last video I made was much to long. </p>

  <section class="section4">
    <p>Catching smallmouth bass is a lot different than largemouth. Smallies are a lot more of an agressive species of fish which hunts for its food. Largemouth on the otherhand are a lazey species that sits around and waits for food to come to it.</p>
    <p>There are two trains of thought when fishing for agressive smallmouth, fish extra fast, or fish extra slow. You can fish baits that move with a very aratic action, and trigger the instinks of the bass in order to make them bite. You can also fish super slow, allowing the smallmouth to see your bait from far away and decide that it wants to eat it. This method plays to smallmouth that are feeding more actively.</p>
    <p>The large majority of the fish that we caught on this trip to Saint Clair were on a dripshot worm. This was taking the approach of fishing very slow because the bas we saw were much more inclined to bite something they could see for a long time that day. Casting and waiting was the simple, easy, and proved most affective way to catch fish this day.</p>
